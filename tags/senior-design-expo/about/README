To get the source for tinyos-2.x, run:

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@tinyos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tinyos co -P tinyos-2.x


SIMULATION:

To simulate the project, build it in the src folder using the command:

  make micaz sim

and then execute run.py in the src folder.  You must have ncc, TOSSIM, and all dependencies
satisfied.  You must also have all necessary global variables set correctly.


REAL DEAL:

To build the actual project, first build in the src folder the remote using the command:

  make -f Makefile.RemoteAppC micaz

and load the resultant program on the mote that is to remain on the ground.  Then build the autopilot using the command:

  make -f Makefile.AutopilotAppC micaz

and load the resultant program on the mote that is to be attached to the helicopter.  To load a program onto a mote, make it using, for instance, one of the above two commands, then, with the mote plugged into the mote programmer and the programmer plugged into a USB port, use the command:

  make micaz reinstall mib520,/dev/ttyUSBn

in which /dev/ttyUSBn should be replaced with the USB port the programmer is plugged into, such as /dev/ttyUSB0.  Make sure the green and red lights are lit on the programmer before this command; hold the programmer and mote steady while it loads.
