To get the source for tinyos-2.x, run:

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@tinyos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tinyos co -P tinyos-2.x


To do any of the following, you must have ncc, TinyOS, and all other dependencies satisfied.  You must also have all necessary global variables set correctly.


SIMULATION:

To simulate the project, build it in the src/sim folder using the command:

  make micaz sim

and then execute run.py in the src folder with the command:

  ./run.py

The output of the program will be in various files in /tmp with the extension "log".


REAL DEAL:

To build the actual project, first build in the src/main folder the remote using the command:

  make -f remote.mk micaz

and load the resultant program on the mote that is to remain on the ground.  Then build the autopilot using the command:

  make -f Makefile micaz

and load the resultant program on the mote that is to be attached to the helicopter.  To load a program onto a mote, make it using, for instance, one of the above two commands, then, with the mote plugged into the mote programmer and the programmer plugged into a USB port, use the command:

  make micaz reinstall mib520,/dev/ttyUSBn

in which /dev/ttyUSBn should be replaced with the USB port the programmer is plugged into, such as /dev/ttyUSB0.  Make sure the big green and red lights are lit on the programmer before this command; hold the programmer and mote steady while it loads.

The Fallback project can be built in src/fallback with the same commands.


DOCUMENTATION:

To generate documentation for a project, in its directory use the command:

  make micaz docs
